*BEWAbot*

_Commands:_
*- !helloBot:* Simple command to get a greeting from bot (to check if bot is working, for example).
*- !sticker:* Send a photo (currently, non-animated) with this in the caption, or tag a photo, to convert it into a sticker. This converts the image as is, so prior cropping may be required.
*- !kiddoShi:* Converts a tagged message to a 'kiddo' style message.
*- !kiddoShit:* Corrupted version of 'kiddoShi' that will convert existing kiddo style parts into regular speak.
*- !toImg:* Tag a sticker (currently, non-animated) with this command to convert it into an image. (Currently, reliability is not guaranteed)
*- !tts:* Tag a message, or insert text after this command (separated by a space after command) to generate a text-to-speech voice file.
*- !rng:* Gives a random number. For more details type the command.
*- !cmdhelp:* Lists all the available commands of the bot.
*- !vote:* ~Shows who one should vote for rightful CR of CSE :)~ Voting is now complete, thank you for the support!
*- !taboo:* Defines a Taboo (word or sentence), which, when mentioned by itself by anyone, kicks that member from the group (though it adds him back after a minute).
